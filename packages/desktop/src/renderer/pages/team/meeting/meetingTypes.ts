// among the teammates via mailboxes, and the backend streams `team.run*` /
// `team.childTurn*` events. The meeting UI is a VIEW over that run plus the
// boss's decision step — it no longer drives turns itself.

/** Coarse meeting phase, derived from the backend team_run lifecycle. */

 * Discussion format — each is a different strategy for squeezing higher quality
 * out of a heterogeneous panel of agents. Encoded as the team_run leader task.
 */
// Every form shares the universal backbone: ① 并行立场 (ALL participants incl. the
// moderator answer the topic SIMULTANEOUSLY, streamed side-by-side) → ② 交锋讨论
// (form-specific) → ③ 综合决议. The form only changes step ②.

  | 'diverge' // ① parallel divergence → ② cluster + converge
  | 'deepdive'; // ② moderator drives multi-round probing to dig the problem to the bottom
